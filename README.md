# Cansat-TinkerCad

This code was written as part of the interdisciplinary project proposed by the courses 'Introduction to Aerospace Engineering' (DEM1064) and 'Algorithms and Programming' (ELC1022) during the first semester of the Aerospace Engineering course at the Federal University of Santa Maria (2021).

Aiming to gain more knowledge about the TinkerCad platform for the progression of the course 'Conception, Design, Implementation, and Operation in Aerospace Engineering I' (DEM1106) during the second semester, some improvements were made (2021-2022).
